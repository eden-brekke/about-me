Reflections and Comments
**How did this go, overall?** *Things went pretty well! If/else statements seem to be working nicely, CSS is a bit tricky but I think I'm getting it.* 
**What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?** *I've been trying to figure out how to make the boxes of my elements in CSS be a bit more form fit to the content inside. I found that padding/margins can kind of aid in this but I imagine that might get a little messy with different devices, I.e will it still show up how I want it to on mobile devices as it does in my browser?*
**How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?** *It took me about three and a half hours to complete the assignment, and I honestly didn't really think about how long it would take before I started, just went in headfirst.*
