Reflections and Comments <br>
**How did this go, overall?** *Things went pretty well! If/else statements seem to be working nicely, CSS is a bit tricky but I think I'm getting it.*  <br>
**What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?** *I've been trying to figure out how to make the boxes of my elements in CSS be a bit more form fit to the content inside. I found that padding/margins can kind of aid in this but I imagine that might get a little messy with different devices, I.e will it still show up how I want it to on mobile devices as it does in my browser?*  <br>
**How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?** *It took me about three and a half hours to complete the assignment, and I honestly didn't really think about how long it would take before I started, just went in headfirst.* <br>

The Unresolved Issues: 

1. For some reason for my first question prompt if you answer "yes" it will return both the alert for yes and alert for no. when looking at my code I can't figure out how to fix this issue, looks like it should work to me :(  <br>

2. I'm having issues with linking my css and js files to my html files. I can either have them linked corrected for GitHub or Linked correctly for LiveServer.<br>

For Correct GitHub linkage I use <br>


< link rel="stylesheet" href="css/reset.css"><br>
  < link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"><br>

< script src="js/app.js">< /script><br>
For Correct Live Server Linkage I need to add /about-me/ to the file paths<br>

< link rel="stylesheet" href="/about-me/css/reset.css"><br>
  < link rel="stylesheet" href="/about-me/css/style.css"><br>
< script src="/about-me/js/app.js">< /script><br>

never both :( :( I've consistently had this problem originating in code 102. I'm not sure why it's happening, the way I need to link it for Live Server doesn't make much sense, since my js and css folders are within the about-me folder, I know I shouldn't need to specify that that is where they are, alas, it wont work when I use the GitHub code shown above.
