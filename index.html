      <h2 id="bio">Biography</h2>
      <p id="bioP">Hello! My name is Eden! I'm a mostly introverted person, but if you get me onto a topic I know a lot
        about, or
        get me into a one-on-one conversation, I can talk your ear off! <br> <br>
        I'm always up to try any activity, I really enjoy trying and learning new things. Jack of all trades, master of
        few.<br> <br>
        I'm always listening to music, I definitely have some go-to music but I'm open to suggestions from any and all
        genres.<br> <br>
        I enjoy being creative, with art, with fashion, with cooking. <br> <br>
        I love my little family, my partner and I are new house owners and we are remodeling our home by ourselves, it's
        been a big project, and a great learning experience. <br> Our two cats; Pumpkin Pie McSassypants, and Monterey
        Jack the
        Third, often try to help us with the remodel, they're an essential part of the team. </p>

      <h2 id="edu">Education History</h2>
      <p id="eduP">My education history is a bit all over the place! <br> <br> Growing up my family has monetary issues,
        so I
        dropped out of
        highschool at an early age to get a job and help provide, food, bills, mental stability. <br> <br> As I
        approached
        adulthood, I had already had a number of jobs within various fields of retail. I decided that maybe I did want
        to
        pursue further education. <br> <br>I got my GED and started to attend community college, I jumped around a few
        ideas,
        culinary arts, welding, but eventually decided that I really valued "life" as a whole and wanted to understand
        the
        science behind it. <br> <br> With this in mind I transfered to the University of Washington for Biological
        sciences and
        obtained my Bachelor's degree.</p>

      <h2 id="job">Job Experience</h2>

      <p class="jobP">As mentioned previously I have a pretty diverse job experience! <br> <br>
        Early in life, I started with department store jobs at places like Walgreens, and Target. <br> <br>
        I then progressed to more specialized retail in Grease Monkey where I worked mostly customer service and front
        desk, JoAnn Fabrics, where I found my love of <b>all things</b> craft, and finally PetSmart where I worked in
        the
        Salon as a dog bather <i>best clients ever</i>. <br> <br>
        I even dabbled in the food industry working at Pizza hut
        as a delivery driver, and my store being one of the rare Pizza Huts that had indoor dining, as a waitress. <br>
        <br>
        During my time in school I found a passion for mathematics and the logic behind it, a skill I never knew I had
        due
        to my previous (lack of) education! My math professor suggested that I become a math tutor and I obliged! <br>
        I found great passion in teaching and helping others. I remained a tutor and teachers assistant through the
        remainder of my education. <br> <br>
        Finally after I finished my education I worked at the University of Washington School of Medicine as a Lab
        Manager
        for the Hyde Lab, a virology lab that studies Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV). <br>
        This is the job I was at when the Pandemic hit, and since our VEEV virus was a single stranded positive sense
        RNA
        virus, just like SARS-CoV-2 is, I was able to pick up work with COVID <br> With our goal being to help to
        understand it's pathogenesis and contibute data towards the vaccine development.

    <article id="goalArticle">
      <h2 id="goal">Life Goals</h2>
      <p id="goalP">My main and Ultimate goal in life is to be happy!<br> <br>
        On top of that a big goal for me is the proud of what I have accomplished and the work that I do.
        In terms of a career I want to learn these software developer skills and apply it back to my career in virology.
        <br> I
        didn't leave science because I was unhappy, but instead that I wanted to learn more skills to help the
        field.<br>
        <br>
        During my time in the lab we had a very kind developer write some simple code that allowed us to analyze viral
        RNA
        structure and how changing individual nucleotides contributed to the pathogenesis of that virus. <br> Through
        cloning
        techniques we were able to show that just a <em>SiNGLE</em> nucleotide change in the 3'UTR (3 prime Untranslated
        region) drastically changed the pathology of VEEV.<br> <br>
        Seeing just how easy this very simple code made this process, that before took us days to do, really sparked my
        motivation to seek out these new skills. I'm very excited to pursue this field and to make connections with my
        peers. <br> <br>
